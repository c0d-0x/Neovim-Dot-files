## Configuration files

- nvim config with vim-plug (This was my old Configuration):
  - This nvim/vim config  relies om  vim-plug as its plugin manager.
  - To use this config, install [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).
  - Then copy my init.vim file to ```~/.config/nvim```.
  - For vim users, copy the vimrc file to `~/.vimrc`
  - run :PlugInstall, to install plugins
  - compile coc be running ```npm ci``` in ```.locale/nvim/plugged/coc```
  - compile coc be running ```npm ci``` in ```~/.vim/plugged/coc``` for vim users
  - It's using coc-language server for code completion and diagnostics, check out [coc](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) for better understanding and usage
